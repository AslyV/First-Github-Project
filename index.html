      <h1>About me</h1>
      <h2>Hello, I'm Asly</h2>
      <p>
        I am a proud girly of the natural hair community. Growing up as an
        Afro-latina from the Domican Republic,my hair has always played a big
        role in my life. At an early age my mom started perming my hair to fit
        western beauty standards. She wasn't educated on how to take care of my
        hair and often reffered to it as "pelo malo", which translates to bad
        hair. This made me view my hair as someting that needed to fixed or
        control. All my memories of getting my hair done as a child are full of
        pain, shame, and discomfort.
